# Notebooks

When you work in Observable, you will be building notebooks. Observable notebooks are __interactive, editable documents defined by code__. In notebooks, you can combine formatted text (in markdown), code (JavaScript, SQL, HTML), and outputs (e.g. customized data tables and visualizations), then share your work with teammates and stakeholders. 

A notebook is both a final product for presentation, and a large blank canvas for trying out ideas and calculations. How do you start? By creating **[cells](/cells/)**. Cells are where you place content — text, JavaScript code, or other instructions.

Observable notebooks have many unique characteristics that allow for efficient collaboration, iteration and reuse. 

## [Collections](/notebooks/collections)
Collections are a way to organize notebooks into custom groups. Notebooks can be added to a single collection or many collections, and collections can be nested within other collections. You can view a users public notebooks as well as their public collections.

## [Forking](/notebooks/forking)
Creating a fork of a notebook means to make your own copy, like suddenly making a fork in the road and going your own way. This is a fundamental concept in software development, but if this idea is new to you, think of it as making a copy of a recipe. Once you have a copy, you can make changes without affecting the original—the forked copy of the recipe is yours to save, modify, or discard as you choose.

## [History](/notebooks/history)
Observable keeps a history of all edits made to a notebook, allowing you to undo (and redo) changes whenever needed. Notebook history lets authors edit fearlessly with the knowledge that they can always go back to a previous version of their notebook. It also allows teams to better understand how their notebooks have changed over time, and who edited them.

## [Imports](/notebooks/imports)
Observable lets you quickly reuse content by importing named cells from other notebooks. Most often you'll import code and functions for reuse, but imports are versatile — you can also import charts, inputs, tables, or text from any named cell. This works with community notebooks, as well as private notebooks within a team. You must have access to a notebook to be able import its cells.

## [Saving](/notebooks/saving)
As Observable keeps a history of all yoru edits to a notebook, it's helpful to understand how saving works with notebooks. Some edits, like in [tinker mode](/collaboration/tinker-mode), do not trigger a save to the original notebook. 

## [Templates](/notebooks/templates)

In addition to forking and importing from notebooks, the Observable team has published dozens of notebook templates to help you get started with common analyses and visualizations. When you create a new notebook, you'll see these templates as boilerplate options. Selecting a template will automatically fork a copy of the template notebook to your space.
