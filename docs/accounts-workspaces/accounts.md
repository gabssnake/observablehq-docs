# Accounts

An Observable account makes it possible for you to use the Observable platform and collaborate with others.


## Create an account
To get started, click the **Sign up** button on https://www.observablehq.com.

:::info Note
If you <a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/fork-suggest-merge">fork</a> a notebook before you have created an account, you will be asked to sign up to save your fork; the dialog box will look very similar to the one below.`)
:::

### Continue with... (or email)
After you click **Sign Up**, you are asked to select an authentication provider. You can choose from several organizations where you may already have an account.

If you choose to sign up with your email address, you'll receive an email link from `notifications@mail.observablehq.com` to confirm your email address. (If you do not see the email, be sure to check your spam folder.)

### Create your display name
After choosing an authentication method, you'll see the **Welcome to Observable** screen where you enter your **display name**.

Your account profile consists of the following items:
- **Avatar**: Every user on Observable has an avatar, which either gets auto-populated from your authentication provider or generated by Observable. If you want to change your avatar after signup, go to your **Settings** and scroll down to **Personal profile**. You will see a link to upload your own avatar image.
- **Display name**: This is the name you entered at signup, and appears on notebooks that you create. You can change your display name at any time by going to your **Settings** and scrolling down to **Personal profile**. You will see a form to change your display name.
- **Username**: Your username was auto-assigned at signup. This name will be used in the URLs for your notebooks. You can change this name once by going to your **Settings** and clicking the **Change username** button. Note that this does not 'free up' your existing username, since you may have shared links with this username.

## Delete an account

:::info Note
Deleting your Observable account means that all of the following will be removed:
- Your authenticated identities/user IDs.
- Your notebooks.
- Your comments in notebooks.
- Your metadata such as secrets, database connections, etc.

In addition, you will be removed from any Observable teams that you are a member of. 

Please be certain that you do want to delete your account before proceeding.

You can delete your Observable account from your **[Settings](https://observablehq.com/settings)** page:

On the **General** page of Settings, click the **Delete account** button:

    alt="Screenshot of the General section on the settings page, with the Delete account item at the bottom"
  />
  
  <figcaption>Click <b>Delete account</b> to delete your account.</figcaption>

If you are a team owner, you will be asked to first remove yourself from all teams that you belong to:

    alt="Screenshot of the Delete your account dialog, with the Delete account button disabled because the user is an owner of several teams and must remove themselves from them first"
  />
  <figcaption>If you are a team owner, you must first remove yourself from all teams.</figcaption>
</figure>

:::info Note
If you are the only member of a team, you will have to delete the team before you can delete your account. In order to do that, please email [support@observablehq.com](mailto:support@observablehq.com).
:::

After that, or if you are an individual account owner, you see the following modal:

<figure>
  <img
    class="screenshot" style="max-width:350px;"
    src="/accounts-workspaces/assets/deleteYourAccountModal@1.png"
    alt="Screenshot of the Delete your account dialog, with two input fields. The first is for the user's username or email, the second requires the words, delete my account, before the delete button becomes active"
  />
  <figcaption>Enter your username or email and type the confirmation phrase to delete your account.</figcaption>
</figure>

Your account will then be scheduled for deletion. If you have specified your email address, you will receive an email confirmation of the deletion request.
