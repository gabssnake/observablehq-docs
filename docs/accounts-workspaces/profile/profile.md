# Profile

Customize your Observable profile to publicly share information about yourself and your work.

## View your profile

When logged in to your Observable account, click on your avatar (or the default placeholder) in the top right of the screen, then click **Your profile**.

Alternatively, from your account Home, click on your avatar or username atop the left navigation bar, then click **View public profile**.

    />

Either of the two paths above will take you to a view of your public profile, where other users can explore recent notebooks or collections, followers (and who you follow), and your shared profile information (e.g. a short bio, websites, and more).

## Edit your profile

To edit your profile, click **Edit profile** in the top right of your browser while viewing your profile:

    />
</figure>

Or, go to your account Settings (either from the left navbar of the home page, or by choosing **Your settings** after clicking on your avatar in the top right of the browser window), then scroll down to the **Personal profile** section.

Once in the **Personal profile** section of your Settings, you will see options to update your avatar image, profile banner, display name, bio, pronouns, website, and public email. Make your edits, then click **Save** to save changes.

## Viewing other user profiles

Clicking a users' name or avatar (e.g., atop a notebook they haver authored) will take you to their user profile. Then, you can choose to [follow them](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/following?collection=@observablehq/editing-publishing-collaborating) to more easily stay up-to-date with their recent work.
