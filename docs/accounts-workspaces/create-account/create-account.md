# Creating your account

Signing up for an Observable account makes it possible for you to use the Observable platform and collaborate with others.

To get started, click the **Sign up** button on https://www.observablehq.com.

:::info Note
If you <a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/fork-suggest-merge">fork</a> a notebook before you have created an account, you will be asked to sign up to save your fork; the dialog box will look very similar to the one below.`)

## Continue with... (or email)
After you click **Sign Up**, you are asked to select an authentication provider. You can choose from several organizations where you may already have an account.

If you choose to sign up with your email address, you'll receive an email link from `notifications@mail.observablehq.com` to confirm that you want to sign up. (If you do not see the email, be sure to check your spam folder.)

Your account profile consists of the following items:
- **Avatar**: Every user on Observable has an avatar. If you want to change the random avatar you are given upon signup, go to your **Settings** and scroll down to **Personal profile**. You will see a link to upload your own avatar image.
- **Display name**: This is the name you entered at signup. This name appears on notebooks that you create, and in **Settings** > **Set authors**. You can change your display name at any time by going to your **Settings** and scrolling down to **Personal profile**. You will see a form to change your display name.
- **Username**: Your username was auto-assigned at signup. This name (and not your display name) will be used in the URLs for your notebooks.
