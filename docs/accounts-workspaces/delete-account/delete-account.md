# Deleting your account


:::info Note
Deleting your Observable account means that all of the following will be removed:
- Your authenticated identities/user IDs.
- Your notebooks.
- Your comments in notebooks.

You can delete your Observable account from your **[Settings](https://observablehq.com/settings)** page:

  <figcaption>Click <b>Settings</b> on your Home page to begin the process of account deletion.</figcaption>
</figure>

On the **General** page of Settings, click the **Delete account** button:

<figure>
  <img
    style="border-radius:2px;box-shadow:0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15), 0 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);margin-left:27px;margin-bottom:20px;max-width: 50%"

  <figcaption>Click <b>Delete account</b> to delete your account.</figcaption>

If you are a team owner, you will be asked to first remove yourself from all teams that you belong to:

<figure>
  <img
    style="border-radius:2px;box-shadow:0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15), 0 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);margin-left:27px;margin-bottom:20px;max-width: 50%"
    src="/accounts-workspaces/delete-account/deleteYourAccountTeams@1.png"
    alt="Screenshot of the Delete your account dialog, with the Delete account button disabled because the user is an owner of several teams and must remove themselves from them first"
  />
  <figcaption>If you are a team owner, you must first remove yourself from all teams.</figcaption>
</figure>

:::info Note
If you are the only member of a team, you will have to delete the team before you can delete your account.

After that, or if you are an individual account owner, you see the following modal:

<figure>
  <img
    style="border-radius:2px;box-shadow:0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15), 0 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);margin-left:27px;margin-bottom:20px;max-width: 50%"
    src="/accounts-workspaces/delete-account/deleteYourAccountModal@1.png"
    alt="Screenshot of the Delete your account dialog, with two input fields. The first is for the user's username or email, the second requires the words, delete my account, before the delete button becomes active"
  />
  <figcaption>Enter your username or email and type the confirmation phrase to delete your account.</figcaption>
</figure>

Your account then will be scheduled for deletion. If you have specified your email address, you will receive an email confirmation of the deletion request.
