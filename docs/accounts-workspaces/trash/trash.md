# Trash

Deleted notebooks are added to the Trash, and are recoverable for **30 days** after deletion. This page describes how to delete notebooks, view Trash contents, and recover notebooks.

## Deleting notebooks

Anyone with permission to edit a notebook can also **delete** a notebook. To delete a notebook, open the Notebook menu with the three-dot menu in the top right, then select Delete. If the Delete option does not appear in the Notebook menu, it means you don't have permissions to delete it.

## Recovering content from the Trash

A deleted notebooks remains in the Trash for 30 days, after which it is permanently deleted.

When you attempt to open a notebook that is currently in the Trash, a message appears letting you know that you cannot edit a notebook while it is in the Trash, and with options to either leave the notebook there, or move it out of Trash.

Once a notebook is removed from the Trash, you are again able to view and make edits as usual. Notebooks removed from the Trash are not automatically re-added to collections they may have existed in before they were deleted.
