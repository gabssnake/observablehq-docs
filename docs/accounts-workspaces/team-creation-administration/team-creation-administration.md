# Team creation and administration

This is one of several related notebooks that describe Observable team and individual workspaces:

- [Team and individual workspaces](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/team-and-individual-workspaces?collection=@observablehq/workspaces): overview and FAQ covering the different types of workspaces.
- [Advantages of team workspaces (this notebook)](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/advantages-of-team-workspaces?collection=@observablehq/workspaces): describes what you can do with team workspaces.
- [Workspace and team creation and administration](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/team-creation-and-administration?collection=@observablehq/workspaces): how to create a team or individual workspace; billing, upgrading, and maintenance.


Creating a team happens on the **[Create your team](https://observablehq.com/team/new)** page:
1. Click your avatar
2. Choose **Create a team**.

From this page you can create a private team (the default) or a free team.

## Creating a Free Team

Here are the steps to create a free team from the [Create your team](https://observablehq.com/team/new) page:
1. For your avatar, click **randomize** to select from the choice of colored circles, or click **Upload new** to upload a custom image.
   
2. Enter the **Display name** for your team.
3. Enter the **Team URL** (this will go to your team's home page, which displays notebooks, collections, and more).

7. Click **Continue**.

Your team is created and you are taken to the Settings page for your team.

## Creating a Pro Team 
If your team requires the ability to work in private and access to private data, create a Pro team. (You can take advantage of the one month free 🎉 trial.) Here are the steps to create a Pro team from the [Create your team](https://observablehq.com/team/new) page.

1. As with the free team, select an **Avatar** and enter the **Team name**.
  
2. Enter the **Team URL** (this will go to your team's home page, which displays notebooks, collections, and more).

3. **Invite team members** by entering each email address or Observable username.
<figure>
  <img
    style="border-radius:2px;box-shadow:0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15), 0 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);margin-left:27px;margin-bottom:20px;max-width: 450px"
    src="/accounts-workspaces/team-creation-administration/inviteTeamMembersFree_V2.png"
    alt="The Invite team members dialog, with an input field for the email and a drop-down for the role."
  />
  <figcaption>Enter the <b>username</b> or <b>email address</b> of each person to be invited to your team.</figcaption>
</figure>

4. Select a role for the team member.
   - **Viewers** can see notebooks, but not edit them. 
     - **Guest Viewers** can only view explicitly shared notebooks in a workspace.
   - **Editors** can edit all notebooks in a workspace. 
    - **Guest Editors** can only edit those explicitly shared. 
   - **Owners** are editors and co-administrators of the team and can add or remove team members or change their roles. They are also the only ones who can permanently delete notebooks by emptying the trash.
   
   Viewers are free; you are charged for the number of editors and owners.

5. Click **Pro** to choose the private team.

<figure>
  <img
    style="border-radius:2px;box-shadow:0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15), 0 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);margin-left:27px;margin-bottom:20px;max-width: 450px"
    src="/accounts-workspaces/team-creation-administration/tiers-pro.png"
    alt="The tier selection dialog, with the Pro option selected."
  />
  <figcaption>Choose <b>Pro</b> to create a private team.</figcaption>
</figure>

6. For **Billing cycle**, choose to pay yearly (discounted) or monthly. Pick monthly billing if your team size will fluctuate throughout the year. Pick yearly billing if you’d prefer a fixed budget.

7. For **Set up billing later** or **Continue to billing**:
   - To try out Observable using the free trial, click **Set up billing later**. Your team is created immediately, and you are taken to the Settings page for your team. Note: each individual or team is eligible for only one free trial.

    - To take care of billing details now, click **Continue to billing**. You are taken to the **Enter payment details** page to enter your payment method. By default, you are signed up for a 30-day free trial.

    - We use Stripe for payment processing and accept credit cards and Apple Pay currently.

    alt="The payment details dialog with input fields for billing email and credit card information."
  />
  <figcaption>Enter your payment details to complete the creation of your Pro team.</figcaption>
</figure>

- Click **Start trial**. Your team is created and you are taken to the Settings page for your team.

:::info Note
All charges are in USD ($).
:::

On your team settings page, you can configure your team's profile picture and various other configurations as described in [Settings](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/settings) and, most importantly, you will be able to invite additional team members.

When inviting team members, you can specify whether you want them to be team owners, editors, guest editors, viewers or guest viewers. Owners are editors with team admin privileges, and are charged the same as editors.  Viewers are free! Note that we do not add a person to a team until the invitation has been accepted.

## Creating an Enterprise Team

The process for creating an Enterprise Team is identical to creating a Pro Team.

Choose **Enterprise** for the additional features of the Enterprise tier (see [Enterprise Features](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/advantages-of-team-workspaces#enterpriseFeatures) for details).

If you need to discuss other payment options, please reach out to our support team at [enterprise-support@observablehq.com](mailto:enterprise-support@observablehq.com).

## Billing, upgrading, and team maintenance

:::info Note
You must be a team owner to make changes affecting team membership or billing.
:::

**Billing information**:
The team's previous invoices as well as estimated charges for the next billing cycle can be viewed in **Settings > Billing**.

Billing is based on the number of owners or editors. 
- Adding viewers is free (guest viewers included).
- Adding editors, guest editors or owners changes the quantity of licenses for the team, which has an impact on billing.
- For this reason, team owners are the only team members who can invite or remove other members from the team, as well as set team roles.

Invitations expire after 10 days, so you may need to re-invite members if they wait too long to accept the invitation.

**Adding team members**:  You are not charged until the invitation is accepted, which causes the team's subscription quantity to be incremented (if the new team member is an owner, editor or guest editor). However, this does not immediately trigger a new invoice.
- If you are billed monthly, your next invoice will include a prorated amount for the fraction of the billing cycle used by the new team member(s).
- If you are billed annually, we will send a new invoice within a month of the change (if there was a net add to the team), to true up the annual license to the new subscription amount. This allows you to remove and add new team members and only deal with the net changes of the team composition once a month.

**Removing team members**: Decrements the subscription quantity. You do not receive a refund if you remove team members during a billing cycle, but adding team members back would not result in a new charge.

**Switching from monthly to annual billing**:
You can switch from monthly to annual billing, which will set a new billing cycle and immediately charge you for the year.

<figure>
  <img
    style="border-radius:2px;box-shadow:0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15), 0 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);margin-left:27px;margin-bottom:20px;max-width: 450px"
    src="/accounts-workspaces/team-creation-administration/billingMonthlyToAnnual.png"
    alt="The billing settings dialog, showing options to pay yearly or monthly."
  />
  <figcaption>You can change from monthly to annual billing from the <b>Change tier</b> modal.</figcaption>
</figure>

**Switching from annual to monthly billing**:
It is likely that the invoice amount will be zero assuming that the prorated credit for billing annually is greater than the new monthly bill (that is, assuming that you switch to monthly billing more than one month from the end of your billing cycle).  Your future monthly charges will be credited with the annual payment until that runs out.

**Changing to a different team tier**: You can change the tier from **Settings**.

Go to **Settings > General**, then click **Change tier**:

<figure>
  <img
    style="border-radius:2px;box-shadow:0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15), 0 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);margin-left:27px;margin-bottom:20px;max-width: 450px"
    src="/accounts-workspaces/team-creation-administration/changeTierFree.png"
    alt="The General settings tab, showing the Chage tier button highlighted."
  />
  <figcaption>Click <b>Change tier</b> to display the Change Tier modal.</figcaption>
</figure>

:::info Note
In a private or Enterprise team, you can also reach the Change tier modal from <b>Settings > Billing</b> (visible only to team owners).
:::

The **Change subscription** modal allows you to select a different team tier:

<figure>
  <img
    style="border-radius:2px;box-shadow:0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15), 0 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);margin-left:27px;margin-bottom:20px;max-width: 450px"
    src="/accounts-workspaces/team-creation-administration/changeTierModal_V3.png"
    alt="The Change subscription dialog, showing options for Free, Pro, and Enterprise."
  />
  <figcaption>The <b>Change subscription</b> modal.</figcaption>
</figure>

**Team cancellation**:  When a team owner cancels the team, by pressing the “Cancel” link in the team settings:
* The team will stay active until their current paid-for billing period ends, at which point the team will become read-only.
* While cancelled, a team owner may not add or remove team members, and outstanding invitations will not be accepted.
* Deactivated teams enter read-only mode, which allows team members to view and transfer private and public notebooks and trash and untrash them, but not create new notebooks or edit existing ones.
* Cancelled teams still appear in members’ user menus, and keep their public profile pages.

(This is also described in our [terms of service](https://observablehq.com/terms-of-service).)

**Team deletion**:  A team owner can request that the team account be deleted by contacting [teams-support@observablehq.com](mailto:teams-support@observablehq.com):
* The team is marked as deleted, and stops appearing in search results, on public listings, and in the user menu of team members.
* All team notebooks, collections, secrets, and database credentials are deleted.
* If the team owner added people to the team before cancelling, there could be a final bill, which will be immediately charged.

**Team delinquency**: 
* The team owner will be notified about failed payment(s).
* If there is no response, the subscription will be cancelled, and the account will become read-only.
* In order to reactivate a delinquent account, the team owner must submit valid payment information or change to the free team tier.
