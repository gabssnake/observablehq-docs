  />

### Billing

If you have a Free Individual or Free Team workspace, there is no charge. A **Change subscription** button is provided here if you decide to change to a Pro Individual, Pro Team, or Enterprise workspace. In that event you will have to set up billing information (after any eligible free trial). Billing is described in detail in [Workspace and team creation and administration](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/team-creation-and-administration?collection=@observablehq/workspaces#billing).

## Settings for Pro Individual workspaces {#proIndividual}

    alt="A screenshot of the settings navigation menu, listing options for General, Secrets, Databases, API Keys, OAuth Tokens, Moderation, and Billing"
  />
  <figcaption>Settings for Pro Individual workspaces.</figcaption>
</figure>

The Pro Individual workspace is like the Free Individual workspace, but adds the following settings:

### Secrets
Shared secrets for use in your team's private notebooks.  Use secrets to store API keys and other sensitive values you donâ€™t want to hard-code in notebooks.

### Databases
Shared database connections for your team's private notebooks.

### API Keys
Use API keys to securely load and embed private notebooks outside of Observable.

### OAuth Tokens
OAuth tokens are used to allow notebooks to access data in cloud files. After you have signed in to the cloud service provider for a given cloud file, an OAuth token is stored in your Settings so that you will not have to sign in each time you want to visit a notebook that requires them. See [Cloud Files](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/cloud-files?collection=@observablehq/getting-data-in-and-out) for more information.

## Settings for Free Team workspaces {#settingsFreeTeam}

  <figcaption>Settings for free teams.</figcaption>
</figure>

For team Settings in general, note that only team owners will see all team Settings, as some features, such as changing team roles, are only available to owners.

### General
Team owners can configure the team's account, profile, and preferences.
- Account
  - Set or change the team's username (which appears in the URLs of the team's profile and notebooks).
  - Change the team tier (for example, from a Free Team to a Pro Team).
  - Set or change the email address to receive notifications and messaging about the team account.
- Profile
  - Customize the team's avatar and banner.
  - Set the team's display name.
  - Write a brief team biography.
  - Specify team Web sites.
  - Specify a publicly-visible email address for the team.
- Preferences
  - Choose whether or not to use [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to format code in all team notebooks.

### Membership
 
Allows you to invite people to become new team members, change their roles, or remove them from the team. Current and invited team members appear in a list, along with their roles. If an invited team member has not yet accepted, their name appears with a **Pending** label.


## Settings for Pro Team workspaces

    class="screenshot" style="max-width:200px;"
    src="/accounts-workspaces/assets/settingsProTeam.png"
    alt="A screenshot of the settings navigation menu, listing options for General, Membership, Secrets, Databases, API Keys, and Billing"
  />
  <figcaption>Settings for Pro teams.</figcaption>
</figure>

The settings for the Pro Team workspace are mostly the same as those seen in workspaces described earlier, with a few differences.

### General
As described in the _General_ section for [Free Individual](#freeIndividual), with the following addition:
- Team preferences
  - Enable or disable newly-created notebooks from being private (not shared with the team).

### Membership
As described in the _Membership_ section for [Free Team](#settingsFreeTeam), with the addition of pricing information for the roles that incur a monthly charge.

In the __[Invite by domain](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/release-notes#cell-2982)__ section, you can setup a domain and default role from which users from your organization will be invited to join your workspace during their account signup process. Once invited, users will automatically have access to all the available assets in that workspace. To note, only owners will be able to see this option in their workspace settings.

### Secrets
As described in the [Pro Individual](#proIndividual) section.

### Databases
As described in the [Pro Individual](#proIndividual) section.

### API Keys
As described in the [Pro Individual](#proIndividual) section.

### Billing (visible only to team owners)
Visible only to team owners. You can change your subscription by altering either the tier or the billing period, and edit the payment method. The timing of your current billing cycle, and the next billing cycle are shown, as well as invoices.

Billing is described in detail in [Workspace and team creation and administration](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/team-creation-and-administration?collection=@observablehq/workspaces#billing).

## Settings for Enterprise team workspaces

The settings for Enterprise team workspaces are identical to the settings for Pro team workspaces, with the exception of **Groups** and **Permissions**.


### Groups

<figure>

    class="screenshot" style="max-width:450px;"
    src="/accounts-workspaces/assets/groups.png"
    alt="A screenshot of the Groups section in the settings, showing different groups with their members"
  />
  <figcaption>Enterprise team workspaces have a <b>Groups</b> section.</figcaption>
</figure>

Groups allow you to share notebooks, collections, database connections and secrets for defined list of users. Under the **Membership** section in your Enterprise workspace settings, you'll find a section for Groups. There you can create a new group by clicking on the "New Group" button, adding a name to your group, and selecting team members to that group. Owners and editors in your Enterprise workspace can create new groups. A workspace editor can add or remove other team members from a group that they are a member of, and they can also delete a group that they are on. A workspace owner can edit or delete any group.

Once you've set up your group, you can share content like you normally would for any individual user. For example, on a notebook, clicking on the share modal and searching for team members will also return Groups, allowing you to easily grant access to multiple team members. Like users, you can grant a group edit and/or view access to content.


### Permissions

  <figcaption>Enterprise team workspaces have an additional <b>Permissions</b> section.</figcaption>
</figure>

Configure [protection of public content](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/advantages-of-team-workspaces#contentProtection) and restricting team members to be [authenticated to your organization only](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/advantages-of-team-workspaces#orgRestrict).
