# Setup a workspace

## Free workspaces

Here are the steps to create a free workspace from the [Create your workspace](https://observablehq.com/team/new) page:
1. For your avatar, click **randomize** to select from the choice of colored circles, or click **Upload new** to upload a custom image.
   
2. Enter the **Display name** for your workspace.
3. Enter the **Workspace URL** (this will go to your workspace's home page, which displays notebooks, collections, and more).

5. Select a role for each workspace member. 
   - **Viewers** can see notebooks, but not edit them. 
     - **Guest Viewers** can only view explicitly shared notebooks in a workspace.
   - **Editors** can edit all notebooks in a workspace. 
    - **Guest Editors** can only edit explicitly shared notebooks in a workspace.
   - **Owners** have all privileges of editors, and also are co-administrators of the team. Owners can add or remove workspace members or change their roles. They are also the only ones who can permanently delete notebooks by emptying the trash.
   
6. Click **Free** to choose a free workspace.

7. Click **Continue**.

Your workspace is created and you are taken to the Settings page for your workspace.

## Pro workspaces
If your workspace requires the ability to work in private and access to private data, create a Pro workspace. (You can take advantage of the one month free ðŸŽ‰ trial.) Here are the steps to create a Pro workspace from the [Create your workspace](https://observablehq.com/team/new) page.

1. As with the free workspace, select an **Avatar** and enter the **Workspace name**.
  
2. Enter the **Workspace URL** (this will go to your workspace's home page, which displays notebooks, collections, and more).

3. **Invite workspace members** by entering each email address or Observable username.

    src="/accounts-workspaces/assets/inviteTeamMembersFree_V2.png"
    alt="The Invite workspace members dialog, with an input field for the email and a drop-down for the role."
  />
  <figcaption>Enter the <b>username</b> or <b>email address</b> of each person to be invited to your team.</figcaption>
</figure>

4. Select a role for the workspace member.
   - **Viewers** can see notebooks, but not edit them. 
     - **Guest Viewers** can only view explicitly shared notebooks in a workspace.
   - **Editors** can edit all notebooks in a workspace. 
    - **Guest Editors** can only edit those explicitly shared. 
   - **Owners** are editors and co-administrators of the workspace and can add or remove workspace members or change their roles. They are also the only ones who can permanently delete notebooks by emptying the trash.
   
   Viewers are free; you are charged for the number of editors and owners.

5. Click **Pro** to choose the private workspace.

    class="screenshot" style="max-width:450px;"

    alt="The tier selection dialog, with the Pro option selected."
  />
  <figcaption>Choose <b>Pro</b> to create a private workspace.</figcaption>
</figure>

6. For **Billing cycle**, choose to pay yearly (discounted) or monthly. Pick monthly billing if your team size will fluctuate throughout the year. Pick yearly billing if youâ€™d prefer a fixed budget.

7. For **Set up billing later** or **Continue to billing**:
   - To try out Observable using the free trial, click **Set up billing later**. Your workspace is created immediately, and you are taken to the Settings page for your workspace. Note: each workspace is eligible for only one free trial.

    - To take care of billing details now, click **Continue to billing**. You are taken to the **Enter payment details** page to enter your payment method. By default, you are signed up for a 30-day free trial.

    - We use Stripe for payment processing and accept credit cards and Apple Pay currently.

</figure>

- Click **Start trial**. Your workspace is created and you are taken to the Settings page for your workspace.

:::info Note
All charges are in USD ($).
:::

On your workspace settings page, you can configure your workspace's profile picture and various other configurations as described in [Settings](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/settings) and, most importantly, you will be able to invite additional workspace members.

When inviting workspace members, you can specify whether you want them to be workspace owners, editors, guest editors, viewers or guest viewers. Owners are editors with workspace admin privileges, and are charged the same as editors.  Viewers are free! Note that we do not add a person to a workspace until the invitation has been accepted.

## Enterprise workspaces

The process for creating an Enterprise workspace is identical to creating a Pro workspace. Once you've set up your workspace, contact the support team at [enterprise-support@observablehq.com](mailto:enterprise-support@observablehq.com) to get started with Enterprise.
