Regardless of the platform, organized team and project management can spare teams from redundant effort, time spent searching for resources, and confusion around authorship and points-of-contact. Working in Observable is no different. Here, we share several project management strategies for teams working in Observable, including how to manage team roles and permissions, and how to use Collections to keep your work organized and easier to navigate.

## Team member roles and permissions

In our guide on [collaboration](/enterprise-pro/collaboration-sharing), we talked about the various ways to work with team members in Observable, either as viewers or editors. In addition to notebook privileges, there are roles for team members that affect their access to the entire team workspace, which you will designate when you [add new team members](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/team-creation-and-administration#cell-127).

There are three types of team members in the team workspace: 
   - **Viewers** can see notebooks, but not edit them.
   - **Editors** can edit notebooks.
   - **Owners** are editors and co-administrators of the team and can add or remove team members or change their roles. They are also the only ones who can permanently delete notebooks

If someone is designated as a **Viewer**, they will not be able to get edit access to any of the notebooks in the team space. If they are an **Editor**, then they can be granted view *or* edit access to any notebook, in addition to being able to create new notebooks.

Team roles and permissions can be adjusted at any time in your team setting.

Observable also supports Single Sign-On (SSO) with OpenID Connect for Enterprise customers. [Our step-by-step guide](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/sso-with-openid-connect?collection=@observablehq/teams-features-2022-2023) will walk you through how to set this up.

## Organizing and navigating collections

[Collections](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/collections) are a great way of organizing your team notebooks into various topics and projects. It's easy to create new collections and add notebooks to them.

Notebooks can be tied to multiple collections, and collections can be nested within other collections.

By default, your collections will remain private, unordered, and will use the thumbnail from the first notebook in the collection. All of these settings can be adjusted on the collection page.

We've covered a lot so far in this Enterprise and Pro Teams onboarding curriculum. Whether you're just getting started or a seasoned Observable user, you'll inevitably have questions, need support, or realize ways that Observable could be improved. In the next section, learn about the different ways that you can [ask for help, provide feedback, and stay up-to-date](/enterprise-pro/getting-help) with what's new in Observable.
