# Following users and teams

If you want to be able to see what your favorite people or teams in Observable are doing, you can do that by **Following** them. By following a user or team you will be able to see a list of their recently edited notebooks on your home page and a new [Following](https://observablehq.com/following) page.

## How to follow (or unfollow) someone

You can follow someone by clicking the 'Follow' button shown in various places. We show a hovercard whenever you hover over a user or team's avatar or name throughout the site:

You can also follow a user from the user's full profile page or from a notebook's header.

If you are following a user, the 'Follow' button is updated to 'Unfollow' to allow you to unfollow the user.

## Your following feed
On your home page, you will see a list of recent notebooks from the people you follow:

## Who is following whom?

When you look at a user's profile page, you can see their followers and also who they are following. This is a great way for you to expand your network of people to follow.
