# Sharing

Observable makes sharing your work with others easy and productive. Whether you are a [Free, Pro, or Enterprise](#moving-up-to-a-team-workspace) user, you can directly share a notebook with selected individuals, allowing them to view and edit the notebook. If you are a team member, you can share your notebooks with the entire team or only individuals on the team.

Users who receive an invitation to share a notebook will receive an email message with an optional message from the person sharing the notebook.

## Individual sharing

Individual sharing allows you to share your notebooks with up to four individually specified collaborators. You can choose to give these collaborators view-only access, or allow them full freedom to make edits.

- With **view-only** access, a collaborator can see and use your notebook, make comments, but they cannot save their changes to the original. 
- With **edit** access, a collaborator can make and save changes to the original too. You, as the notebook owner, retain control over who has edit access to the notebook. If you are a Pro user, you also retain control over whether or not the notebook is made public.

You can work with your collaborators in real-time and you will see each other's edits live, as they are typed.

## Team sharing

You can share with individual members of your team, granting view or edit permission.

If you are a member of a team, you can grant permission to your entire team. The same choices apply: 

- Can view or edit (which will allow team viewers to view and team editors to edit)
- Can view
- No access

You can also grant permission to specific notebooks to users who are outside of your team using guest viewer or guest editor roles.

- **Guest viewer:** The person who needs to read, search and comment on team notebooks explicitly shared with them.
- **Guest editor:** The person who needs edit notebooks explicitly shared with them. Guests are not able to create new notebooks, fork and suggest on notebooks, or update the sharing for other members on a notebook.

## How do I enable sharing?

Sharing can be controlled using the **Share** button.

The Share modal displays the available sharing options, which will vary depending on whether you are a member of a team and what tier your team is on.

When you open the sharing options, you will see a list of users that you have shared the notebook with already and whether their sharing is restricted to viewing, or includes editing. 

<figure>

    style="border-radius:2px;box-shadow:0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15), 0 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);margin-left:27px;margin-bottom:40px;max-width: 70%"

  />
  <figcaption>To share your notebook with additional people, click <b>Add</b>; to remove a user, click the <b>x</b>.</figcaption>
</figure>

You can remove users or add additional ones by entering their Observable login names.  When a notebook is shared with you, meaning you are not the owner, you can still see who else the notebook is shared with, and you can remove yourself from the list if you choose, but only the owner can add additional users.

## Inviting new users to share

If the person you wish to collaborate with is not already an Observable user, or you're not sure, you can invite them to share the notebook by entering their email address in the sharing dialog. This will send them an invitation which they can accept and create their own Observable login, or use one they already have. A sharing invitation can only be used by one user, and you can rescind the invitation before it is used if you want.

When you invite someone to share your notebook, you can add an invitation message if you like:

    style="border-radius:2px;box-shadow:0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15), 0 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);margin-left:27px;margin-bottom:40px;max-width: 70%"

  />

The invitee then receives the message via email:

    style="border-radius:2px;box-shadow:0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15), 0 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);margin-left:27px;margin-bottom:40px;max-width: 70%"

Note that if you invite a user to collaborate on a private notebook, and they are not in a Pro or Enterprise workspace, they will see a message indicating that they must have a Pro membership to access the notebook:

## Moving up to a team workspace

Invidual sharing is limited to four users besides yourself. To share your notebook with an unlimited number of users, you can create an Observable Team. See our [pricing page](https://observablehq.com/pricing) for details about Free teams, Pro teams, and Enterprise teams.

## Group Sharing
Enterprise workspaces have the ability to share notebooks with **Groups**, which are defined lists of users on a given workspace. To learn more about how to setup and use groups, check out our [Enterprise workspace settings.](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/workspace-settings#cell-145).
