# Getting Started 

Observable streamlines the path from data to insights &mdash; for both individuals and teams. In Observable notebooks, users can quickly access their data and combine text, analyses, and data visualizations in the same place. Collections of code snippets and low-code features allow anyone to quickly build or modify notebooks. Observable is built for collaboration and sharing, so that more people can explore, work with, and contribute to discussions around data.

## The Notebook

What you are reading now — this page or document — is an Observable notebook. Observable notebooks are __interactive, editable documents defined by code__. 

All content in notebooks is made in cells. Within cells, you can author formatted text (in markdown) and code (JavaScript, SQL, HTML) to view right alongside customized data tables and visualizations. Then, quickly share your work with teammates and stakeholders to get everyone literally on the same page.

A notebook is both a final product for presentation, and a blank canvas for data analysis, exploration, and creative tinkering. With zero software installation or environment setup required, the barriers to get up and running in an Observable notebook are low for coders and non-coders alike. 


## Upload data, visualize and add interactivity in minutes

At Observable, we aim to help everyone — regardless of their previous experience with data, writing code, or building visualizations — get from data to insights with the least possible friction. In Observable notebooks, a wealth of features and code snippets for low-code data access, analysis, and visualization exist at your fingertips.

#### Upload data

In Observable, you can quickly access your own data by attaching local files or spreadsheets, connecting to [APIs](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/working-with-apis-remote-files?collection=@observablehq/working-with-data), and &mdash; for Enterprise and Pro users &mdash;, connecting to [databases](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/databases) or [cloud files](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/cloud-files). Here is an example of uploading a CSV file to an Observable notebook, and viewing its contents in a data table. 

<div style="max-width: 640px; border-radius: 5px; overflow: hidden; padding: 1rem;">

</div>

#### Visualize data with Plot

The [Observable Plot](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot) library lets you quickly build and customize data visualizations. Code snippets are provided in the [cell menu](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/adding-cells?collection=@observablehq/notebook-fundamentals) as a starting point for many common chart types. They help get you up and running quickly with your own visualizations by simply substituting your data and variable names.

</div>

#### Add interactivity

[Observable Inputs](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/inputs) are lightweight interface components (including buttons, sliders, dropdowns, tables, and text inputs) that help you explore data and build interactive displays. You can also find them in the cell menu.

Once you've added an Input to your notebook, link its value to one or more elements of a chart to add interactivity. Since your Observable notebook is _on_ the web and in the language _of_ the web, your interactive chart is immediately shareable with collaborators.

## Made for collaboration
At Observable, we believe that collaboration is key to doing responsible, innovative work with data. That's why we support several ways to collaborate with others in notebooks, whether it's co-editing a visualization or adding comments to an analysis. Here are a few ways that Observable is built with collaboration in mind.

#### Multiplayer editing
You can invite others to join and edit notebooks with you. Edits are live and visible to all users who are present at the same time. You can see other active users' avatars at the top of the screen. Click on them to automatically follow them around the notebook!

#### Explore, comment and discuss — right in the notebook

Collaborators and stakeholders don't require edit access to contribute to work in an Observable notebook. Anyone with view access can interact with notebooks using [inputs](https://observablehq.com/d/a6eb5a18f8943489?collection=@observablehq/enterprise-training-curriculum#cell-22), and can give feedback and participate in discussions using [comments](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/comments). Comments get sent to the original editor so they can respond and resolve.
